# BBBP Neural Network Learning Project
(Under development)
A simple Jupyter notebook project for learning about Blood-Brain Barrier Penetration (BBBP) prediction using Neural Networks. This project is part of my learning journey in machine learning and cheminformatics.

## What is BBBP?

The Blood-Brain Barrier is a crucial biological barrier that protects the brain from potentially harmful substances while allowing essential nutrients to pass through. Predicting whether a molecule can penetrate this barrier is vital for drug development.

## Project Contents

- `neural_network.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook containing the learning implementation
- `data/BBBP.csv`: Dataset with molecule SMILES and BBBP classification

## Requirements

Basic Python packages:
- pandas
- rdkit
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow/keras

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required packages
3. Open and run the `neural_network.ipynb` notebook

## Note

This is a learning project - the implementation and results are for educational purposes only.
